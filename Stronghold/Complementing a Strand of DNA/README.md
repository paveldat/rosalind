## [Complementing a Strand of DNA](https://rosalind.info/problems/revc/)

### Problem
In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.

The reverse complement of a DNA string `s` is the string `sc` formed by reversing the symbols of `s`, then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").

<b>Given:</b> A DNA string `s` of length at most 1000 bp.

<b>Return:</b> The reverse complement `sc` of `s`.
