## [Transcribing DNA into RNA](https://rosalind.info/problems/rna/)

### Problem
An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'U'.

Given a DNA string t
 corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string u
 is formed by replacing all occurrences of 'T' in t
 with 'U' in u
.

<b>Given:</b> A DNA string `t` having length at most 1000 nt.

<b>Return:</b> The transcribed RNA string of `t`.
