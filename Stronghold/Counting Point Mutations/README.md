## [Counting Point Mutations](https://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/)

### Problem
Given two strings `s` and `t` of equal length, the Hamming distance between `s` and `t`, denoted `dH(s,t)`, is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in `s` and `t`.

<b>Given:</b> Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).
<b>Return:</b> The Hamming distance dH(s,t).
